# Mini-Project

Write a program that will accept a plaintext and running key. The program should print out the ciphertext associated to the inputs. To make sure that the encryption worked, the program should also print the original plaintext based on performing the decryption of the ciphertext. In addition, the program should continue to perform the encryption (and decryption) as long as the user wants to encrypt another plaintext.
